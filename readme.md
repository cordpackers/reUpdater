# reUpdater

A open source alternative to/replacement of Discord's Rust-programmed `updater.node`.

For questions read `faq.md`.

## Status

Currently the completion status is 2% in my estimation. It's not 100% usable yet.

## Usage

Download the latest `index.js` file. Go to `discordDir/app-latest.version.here/`, delete (or rename) the `updater.node` file and create a folder named `updater`. Finally place the `index.js` file inside.

Alternatively you can package this with a repacker. (recommended method if you want to test)
